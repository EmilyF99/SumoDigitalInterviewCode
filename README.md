## Description
Following an Interview with Sumo Digital I was assigned to take a Tutorial, Complete it and Add Extra Features as part of my submission piece.

Completing the tutorial gives the developer a game that keeps track of a score, generates enemies and power-ups on dice rolls, collision with the player and allows the player to shoot enemy objects. 

## Features Added 
- The player Can Press M to Mute the Game
- Score was moved to the top left of the Screen
- Start and Game Over Screen added
- The player gets an extra life every 10,000 Points
- The player gets and bonus round where only coins are spawned every 25,000 Points
- Sprites Resized to make the game easier
- Lives implemented, the player starts with three lives
- audio additions for extra life and bonus round
